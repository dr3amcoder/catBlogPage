## Developer's note
A cat blog page created following the **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum** provided by **Freecodecamp**. <br>
This is an on-going personal project I plan to work on to improve gradually. <br>
The plan is to convert this into a *full stack monolithic architecture*. <br>
For now, please view this static single page on the below site: <br>

This project has been deployed using **Github Pages**.
